🧠 ALX Project Nexus – Backend Engineering Journey
🚀 Overview

This repository highlights my learning journey through the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program.
It documents the technologies, concepts, and best practices I have mastered while building scalable backend systems using Python, Django, GraphQL, and more.
🧰 Key Technologies Covered

Python – Core programming, data structures, and algorithms

Django – Building full-featured web applications and APIs

REST APIs – Designing and implementing RESTful services

GraphQL – Building flexible and efficient data querying APIs

Docker – Containerizing applications for deployment

CI/CD – Automating builds, testing, and deployment pipelines
🗄️ Important Backend Development Concepts

Database Design – Modeling entities, relationships, and constraints using ERD and normalization

Asynchronous Programming – Improving performance using async/await and background tasks

Caching Strategies – Enhancing speed and efficiency using Redis and query optimization
🧩 Challenges Faced & Solutions

Challenge: Managing complex data relationships
Solution: Applied proper relational design with foreign keys and many-to-many models.

Challenge: Slow API responses under heavy load
Solution: Implemented caching and asynchronous background jobs.

Challenge: Containerization errors in deployment
Solution: Used Docker Compose for consistent local and production environments.
🌟 Best Practices & Takeaways

Write clean, modular, and reusable code

Follow proper version control workflows (feature branches, PRs, and commits)

Document APIs using tools like Swagger and GraphiQL

Automate testing and deployment to ensure continuous integration

Never stop learning — backend engineering is about adaptability
